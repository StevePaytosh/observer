/* 
 * Observers primary function will be to monitor
 * tempeture conditions in a room, display that data to
 * a screen and store that data in a database.
 * 
 * 
 * The program is intended to be run on a raspberry pi or similar microcontroller
 * 
 * When tempetures exceed a minimum threshold, the program
 * should send out an email to relevant parties the room has become to
 * hot. The email should be repeated only once per hour while the room
 * is still too hot.
 * 
 * Similar behaivor should be enabled for cold tempetures.
 * 
 * database storage and emails should be handled
 * as API requests in order to minimize stress on the unit hosting this program
